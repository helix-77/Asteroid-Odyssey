     - `__tests__/crater-visualization.test.tsx` - Crater component tests  
     - `__tests__/tsunami-visualization.test.tsx` - Tsunami component tests
   - **Coverage**: Component rendering, data loading, user interactions, calculations

10. **Added loading states and error handling**
    - **Problem**: Poor UX with no loading feedback
    - **Solution**: Comprehensive loading and error states
    - **Features**:
      - Loading spinners for data fetching
      - Error messages with fallback data
      - Disabled states during loading
      - Progress indicators during simulation
      - Graceful degradation when data fails to load
