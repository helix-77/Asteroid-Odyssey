# üéØ WORKING ASTEROID IMPACT SIMULATOR

## ‚úÖ WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS NOW:

### 1. **ASTEROID SELECTION** 
- Dropdown with 5 real asteroids
- Shows size, threat level, composition
- Displays asteroid details when selected

### 2. **IMPACT LOCATION**
- Click anywhere on the world map
- Sets impact coordinates
- Shows location name and population data

### 3. **SIMULATION EXECUTION**
- "Run Simulation" button actually works
- Calculates real impact physics
- Generates timeline with 50 steps over 1 hour

### 4. **VISUAL TIMELINE ANIMATION**
- **Play/Pause buttons** - Start/stop the animation
- **Reset button** - Go back to beginning  
- **Timeline slider** - Scrub through manually
- **Time display** - Shows minutes after impact
- **Step counter** - Shows current frame

### 5. **MAP VISUALIZATION THAT CHANGES**
- **Red crater zone** - Grows slightly over time
- **Expanding damage circles** - 3 zones that grow outward
- **Color-coded by filter** - Different colors for different damage types
- **Population centers** - Yellow circles, turn red/orange when affected

### 6. **FILTER SYSTEM**
- **Casualties** (red) - Shows population impact
- **Infrastructure** (orange) - Shows facility damage  
- **Geological** (brown) - Shows physical destruction
- **Climate** (blue) - Shows atmospheric effects

### 7. **REAL DATA INTEGRATION**
- Population density from JSON files
- Infrastructure locations with types
- Distance-based damage calculations
- Casualty rates based on proximity

### 8. **SIDEBAR DATA DISPLAY**
- **Overview tab** - Crater size, explosion strength, temperature change
- **Casualties tab** - Deaths, injured, displaced counts
- **Infrastructure tab** - Facilities destroyed, nuclear risk, economic damage

## üéÆ HOW TO USE:

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3000/impact-simulator`
2. **Select asteroid** from dropdown (e.g., "Impactor-2025")
3. **Click on map** to set impact location (try New York or Tokyo)
4. **Adjust parameters** if desired (angle, velocity)
5. **Click "Run Simulation"** - Wait 2 seconds for calculation
6. **Watch the animation**:
   - Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to start timeline animation
   - See circles expand outward from impact point
   - Watch population centers change color as damage spreads
   - Use slider to scrub through timeline manually
7. **Try different filters** - Click buttons to see different damage types
8. **Check sidebar data** - Switch between tabs to see detailed numbers

## üî• WHAT YOU'LL SEE:

- **Immediate**: Red crater appears at impact site
- **0-12 minutes**: Primary blast wave expands (bright colored circle)
- **12-36 minutes**: Secondary shockwave spreads (medium opacity)
- **36-60 minutes**: Full damage zone reached (light opacity)
- **Population centers**: Turn from yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red as affected
- **Real numbers**: Casualties, economic damage, recovery time in sidebar

## üéØ WORKING FEATURES CONFIRMED:

‚úÖ Asteroid selection dropdown works
‚úÖ Map clicking sets impact location  
‚úÖ Simulation runs and calculates results
‚úÖ Timeline animation plays automatically
‚úÖ Manual timeline scrubbing works
‚úÖ Filter buttons change visualization
‚úÖ Population centers show damage
‚úÖ Crater and damage zones expand over time
‚úÖ Sidebar shows real calculated data
‚úÖ All controls are responsive

**NO MORE WEIRD BOXES OR BROKEN FEATURES!**

The simulator now provides a meaningful, visual representation of asteroid impact effects that changes over time with proper controls and real data backing.
