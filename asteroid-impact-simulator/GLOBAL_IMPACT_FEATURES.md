- **Orange circles**: Moderate damage (infrastructure collapse)
- **Red circles**: Severe casualties (mass evacuation)
- **Dark red circles**: Total destruction (complete devastation)

### **INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE SYSTEM**
- **Original colors**: Intact facilities (Military=red, Energy=orange, Cultural=purple, Civilian=green)
- **Orange markers**: Affected facilities (power outages, communication loss)
- **Red markers**: Damaged facilities (partial destruction)
- **Dark red markers**: Severely damaged (major structural failure)
- **Black markers**: Completely destroyed facilities
- **Nuclear warning**: Special alerts for compromised nuclear facilities

- **Pause button**: Stop at any point to examine effects
- **Timeline slider**: Scrub through any point in the year
- **Reset button**: Return to impact moment
- **Time display**: Shows seconds ‚Üí minutes ‚Üí hours ‚Üí days ‚Üí months ‚Üí years

### **REAL DATA INTEGRATION**
- **Population density**: Based on actual city populations
- **Infrastructure locations**: Real military bases, power plants, cultural sites
- **Distance calculations**: Accurate geographic measurements
- **Damage models**: Physics-based destruction calculations

## üéÆ **HOW TO EXPERIENCE THE GLOBAL IMPACT:**

1. **Select a large asteroid** (Impactor-2025 or Didymos-B for best effect)
2. **Click on a major population center** (New York, Tokyo, London, etc.)
3. **Run the simulation**
4. **Click PLAY and watch**:
   - Immediate crater formation
   - Expanding devastation zones
   - Population centers changing from green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red ‚Üí black
   - Infrastructure markers changing colors as they're destroyed
   - Global effects spreading across continents
5. **Try different filters** to see:
   - Casualties: Human impact spreading globally
   - Infrastructure: Facilities being destroyed in waves
   - Climate: Atmospheric effects covering hemispheres
6. **Use the timeline slider** to examine specific time periods:
   - First few hours: Local devastation
   - First week: Regional collapse
   - First month: Continental effects
   - First year: Global aftermath

## üåç **GLOBAL IMPACT ZONES:**

### **Crater Zone (Permanent)**
- Dark red circle at impact site
- Permanent geological scar
- Complete obliteration

### **Total Devastation (<500km)**
- Dark red zone
- 100% casualty rate
- All infrastructure destroyed
- Uninhabitable for decades

### **Regional Destruction (<2000km)**
- Colored zone (filter-dependent)
- 50-90% casualty rate
- Major infrastructure collapse
- Economic collapse

### **Continental Effects (<5000km)**
- Medium opacity zone
- 10-50% casualty rate
- Widespread infrastructure damage
- Climate disruption begins

### **Global Effects (Hemisphere+)**
- Light opacity covering vast areas
- Long-term climate effects
- Agricultural disruption
- Economic recession worldwide

## üî• **WHAT MAKES THIS REALISTIC:**

- **Scale**: Effects can span entire continents and hemispheres
- **Time**: 1-year progression shows long-term consequences
- **Population**: Real cities with actual population densities
- **Infrastructure**: Actual locations of critical facilities
- **Physics**: Distance-based damage calculations
- **Progression**: Realistic timeline of how effects spread

**This is no longer just "expanding circles" - it's a comprehensive visualization of how an asteroid impact would affect human civilization on a global scale over an entire year.**
