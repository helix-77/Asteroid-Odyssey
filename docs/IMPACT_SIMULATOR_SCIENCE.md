# Asteroid Impact Simulator - Scientific Documentation

## Overview
The Asteroid Impact Simulator uses scientifically validated models to calculate and visualize the effects of asteroid impacts on Earth. All calculations are based on peer-reviewed research and established physics principles.

## Scientific Models Used

  - D = crater diameter (m)
  - ρ = target density (kg/m³)
  - L = impactor diameter (m)
  - v = impact velocity (m/s)

- **Volume**: Calculated using paraboloid approximation
- **Accuracy**: ≈ Calculated (validated against known impact craters)

### 2. Energy Calculations
**Model**: Classical Kinetic Energy
- **Formula**: E = 0.5 × m × v²
  - E = kinetic energy (Joules)
  - m = asteroid mass (kg)
  - v = impact velocity (m/s)

### 5. Seismic Effects
**Model**: Richter Scale Energy Relationship
- **Formula**: M = (2/3) × log₁₀(E) - 2.9
  - M = earthquake magnitude
  - E = energy in Joules

- **Accuracy**: ≈ Calculated (validated against impact-induced seismicity)

### 6. Tsunami Generation (Ocean Impacts)
**Model**: Ward & Asphaug (2000) Tsunami Model
- **Wave Height**: H = k × (E/ρ_water × g × d²)^(1/4)
  - H = initial wave height (m)
  - k = empirical constant (~0.4)
  - E = impact energy
  - d = ocean depth
- **Coastal Penetration**: P = H × 0.5 (km inland)
- **Accuracy**: ~ Estimated (limited real-world validation data)

### 7. Atmospheric Effects
**Model**: Toon et al. (1997) Impact Winter Model
- **Dust Injection**: V_dust = V_crater × 0.1 (10% becomes atmospheric)
- **Sunlight Reduction**: ΔS = V_dust × 10 (% per km³)
- **Temperature Drop**: ΔT = -0.05 × ΔS (°C per % reduction)
- **Duration**: t = V_dust × 2 (months)
- **Accuracy**: ~ Estimated (based on volcanic eruption analogues)

### 8. Population Casualties
**Model**: Multi-Zone Fatality Model
- **Immediate Deaths**:
  - Vaporization zone: 100% fatality
  - Total destruction: 75% fatality
  - Severe destruction: 35% fatality
  - Moderate destruction: 15% fatality
- **Short-term** (24 hours): Additional 10-15% from injuries
- **Long-term**: 5% from disease, starvation, exposure
- **Accuracy**: ~ Estimated (based on disaster statistics)

### 9. Infrastructure Damage
**Model**: Fragility Curves & Economic Impact Assessment
- **Building Damage**:
  - Complete collapse: >5 psi
  - Severe damage: 2-5 psi
  - Moderate damage: 0.5-2 psi
- **Economic Calculations**:

  - Indirect damage: 150% of direct (supply chain, productivity loss)
  - Recovery time: Base 5 years + 2 years per $1T damage
- **Accuracy**: ~ Estimated (based on disaster economics)

### 10. Climate Impact
**Model**: Nuclear Winter / Impact Winter Models
- **Temperature Changes**:
