## Impact Marker

After impact (15%+), a permanent red pin marker appears:

```
    📍
    /\
   /  \
  |  ⊕ |  ← Impact location
   \  /
    \/
```

## Real-Time Scaling

The animation is compressed for viewing, but represents real-world timescales:

| Animation Phase  | Real Time       | Compressed To |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Approach         | Minutes         | 0-15% (3s)    |
| Impact Flash     | Milliseconds    | 15-25% (2s)   |
| Fireball         | Seconds         | 25-40% (3s)   |
| Blast Wave       | Seconds-Minutes | 30-80% (10s)  |
| Crater Formation | Seconds         | 40-70% (6s)   |
| Seismic Waves    | Minutes         | 50-100% (10s) |

**Total Animation**: ~20 seconds (represents ~10-30 minutes of real events)

## Scientific Accuracy

Each phase is based on:

- ✅ Established physics models
- ✅ Nuclear weapons test data
- ✅ Historical impact observations
- ✅ Peer-reviewed research
